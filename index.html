        Limited Life was the fourth installment of "The Life Series" which is a hardcore Minecraft series where each player has 3 lives (Green, Yellow, and Red) before they are out of the game with each season having its own twist. Other basic rules are that as a Green and Yellow life you are peaceful, but on your last life (Red) you immediately have to cut ties with and become hostile to everyone.<br>
        In Limited Life the new twist was the time system, each player starts with 24 hours to live and the time goes down as they play. Players with 16+ hours had a green name, players with yellow names had 8-16 hours, and players with red names had less than 8 hours. If the player died they would lose 1 hour of time. If a person on their red life killed somebody the red life would gain 30 minutes of time. This season yellows were allowed to attack green names (only) and the same things applied to them as applied to red names when attacking a player. <br>
        This season also saw the return of The Boogeyman from Last Life (Season 2). Each session a random player was chosen to be the Boogeyman who then had to kill one other player before the end of the session to be "cured", otherwise they would lose time until they went down to the next color. Red names could not be a Boogeyman. Being a Boogeyman doubles all time being gained and lost, meaning if a player died to a Boogeyman they would lose 1 hour and if you killed somebody as a Boogeyman you would gain 2 hours of time.<br>
        Other changes made this season were:<ol style="list-style-type: circle;"">
          <li>Keep Inventory was turned on so that players would not lose all their gear after dying</li>
          <li>Red names did not have to cut ties with other players</li>
          <li>After not being allowed in Last Life, Golden Apples and Potions are now allowed</li><br>
          The world seed number for Limited Life was -3481310750187526498, played in version 1.19.9, but generated in 1.17 to avoid too big cave systems.
