        &#11450; &#11450; &#11450;<br>
        SolidarityGaming (AKA Jimmy or Timmy) was one of the original 14 members and has participated in all 7 seasons of the Life Series and both April Fools specials. He went out first (haha loser) in the first 4 seasons (3rd, Last, Double and Limited Life). During Secret Life (Season 5) LDShadowLady (AKA Lizzie) went out first and Jimmy went out 2nd. During Wild Life (Season 6) Jimmy did significantly better in placement and came in 12th out of 18 players, and got eliminated on exactly the same tick as Lizzie, giving them a tied placement. Past Life (Season 7) was the season Jimmy placed best in, coming in 4th.
        <br> Jimmy has been a part of many other SMP’s including:<ol style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Evolution SMP</li>
            <li>Legacy SMP</li>
            <li>X Life SMP</li>
            <li>Empires SMP</li>
            <li>Afterlife SMP</li>
            <li>Newlife SMP</li>
        He has also been a guest on the Hermitcraft SMP a few times, but is not a member (yet) and has been a regular contestant in Minecraft Championship (MCC) since MCC1
