        Grian is the founder of the Life Series and one of the original 14 members from 3rd Life. Grian started out on YouTube making Minecraft tutorial videos and eventually started gaining a lot of traction.<br>
        Eventually Grian was invited to join the Hermitcraft SMP and has participated in every season since Season 6.<br>
        Some of Grians earlier projects included the Yandere High School, and Tokyo Soul roleplays and the Evolution SMP. Grian also worked with a number of other YouTubers (Who were also his friends) in his early days of YouTube including Taurtis, DomRao, Mumbo Jumbo, GoodTimesWithScar, and PearlescentMoon.<br>
        Grian is also very well known for his involvement with the Wynncraft MMOPRG Minecraft Server. He was one of the main leads for the project and after his YouTube channel started to grow he stepped away from Wynncraft to focus more on his channel.<br>
        Google says he is still active on Wynncraft but then in the same paragraph it says he hasn't been online since 2019.
