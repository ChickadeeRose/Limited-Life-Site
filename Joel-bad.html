        &#11450; &#11450; &#11450;<br>
        SmallishBeans(AKA Joel) was one of the original 14 members and has participated in all 7 seasons of the Life Series and both April Fools specials. Joel's playstyle is usually on the more chaotic side which usually results in him having one of the most impressive kill count in most seasons. He was also the first player ever to reach a double digit kill count with 11 kills in Last Life (Season 2). <br>
        Joel started his youtube career playing Call of Duty, but switched to minecraft and has become very popular since. He married another YouTuber LDShadowLady (AKA Lizzie) around 2017 and in August of 2025 they announced that they had a baby girl.<br>
        Joel has been part of many popular SMPS including Empires The Life Series and Afterlife, and got the chance to join hermitcraft in 2024. Joel has also been a regular contestant in the Minecraft Championships since his debut in MCC1 with his most impressive MCC being MCC* which was the first time he won, and did so with an impressive 1V3 clutch in the final game, Dodgebolt.
